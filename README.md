# EmployeeAttrition

### Introduction
Machine Learning (ML) has the ability to explore the algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on a given data. Organizations, due to their strategic demands, invest much time and effort in workforce hiring. When employeeâ€™s attrition, the companies not only lose a productive staff member but also the resources and funds, in particular, the efforts of HR staff by hiring and selecting certain staff members and training them for their related tasks is invested in them. 

##### This work considers the prediction and analysis of employee attrition using Machine Learning models. Applying on IBM dataset, five main tests were conducted to predict employee attrition using classifiers such as KNN, SVM, DT, RF classifiers, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 

### Algorithms
* The KNN algorithm scans the TR set for the K nearest samples for each sample X_test in the TS set. As a result, the KNN computes the distances between X_test and all of TR's samples using Euclidean distance which is the most common measure for this purpose or Manhattan distance. The k value chosen can have an effect on the technique's efficiency and noise tolerance.
